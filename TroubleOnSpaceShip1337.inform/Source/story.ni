"TroubleOnSpaceShip1337" by Rafe McAtee

When play begins, say "pppsssshhhâ€¦  The protective tinted glass of the pod door lifts off of your body.  You blink your eyes as you slowely drift into conciousness.  You have a massive headache and the lights in this room hurt your eyes.  Even in zero gravity, you strugle to clamber out of your sleeping pod but your muscles have atrophied slightly making it difficult.  The moment you exit the pod, the sleeping pod folds itself up and becomes flush with the floor."
