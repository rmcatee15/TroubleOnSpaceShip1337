pppsssshhhâ€¦  The protective tinted glass of the pod door lifts off of your body.  You blink your eyes as you slowly drift into consciousness.  You have a massive headache and the lights in this room hurt your eyes.  Even in zero gravity, you struggle to clamber out of your sleeping pod but your muscles have atrophied slightly making it difficult.  The moment you exit the pod, the sleeping pod folds itself up and becomes flush with the floor.  There is a closet door to the east and a space ship door to the north.

You are surrounded by a beatiful scene of starts.  The thrusters of the ship are currently off.  They were likely shut down in order to delay the imminent collision.  This makes it possible for you to hold on to the side of the ship and not float off into deep space, however you are still to afraid to traverse the outside of the ship.  From the outside, the space ship is covered in tiled peices of metal.  You can see a section where there is a huge dent in the ship.  It is within arms reach.

You can see an outer door here.
